***OUTDATED SINCE v0.80 INPUT HANDLING REBUILD***

Input.h/Input.cpp

Currently, the way input is handled is that first initialization() clears the contents of the strings file and command. This is done incase the function was called to restart
the program due to an unknown command or file. In any case, it is good to clear.
Next, it calls the getUserInput(), wherein a user will enter both the command and file  location in a single string.
This string is then passed into getUserInput() where it must be dissected into the command part and the file location part. This is done by cutting at the ' ' empty space and
feeding the command/file location string into it's respective variable in main.cpp. The feeding is done since each function requires passes references to the variables in the
arguments.
The retrieveCommand() is pretty straightforward as it scans through every char in the string and stops until it gets to the ' ' empty space. The part before is considered the
command and the location it stopped at is where retrieveFile() will start its scan. If it gets to the end and there is no ' ' empty space, then there must be no file given and
so the entire userInput is a command.
At retrieveFile(), it starts from where retrieveCommand() stopped (i.e. at fileStartingPoint) unless of it never stopped. If it never stops, then it doesn't bother retrieving
the file location. If it did, then it cuts the remainder. NOTE: The remainder is not necessarily a file location as there could be other crap written after. This is fine as it
will check for this at checkFile().
Now, the second part of initialization() starts, which is userInputCheck(). First, it checks the command with commandCheck().
With commandCheck(), it prioritizes the keywords not associated with encryption/decryption, but still has a meaning to the program. These currently being: exit and cls.
The exitCheck() checks if the user requested to exit, and if they do ends the program.
Afterwards, isClearCheck() starts to see if the user requested to clear the screen. If so, it will clear the screen using system("cls"), then call initialization() again to
restart the process.
Now that the operations are checked, commandCheck() checks to see whether the user wants to encrypt or decrypt and updating the status to the appropriate state.
If neither of the above operations occur, then the user must have entered an invalid/unrecognized command and so initialization() is called to restart the process.
Lastly, checkFile() is what checks the remainder of userInput. First, if it is empty, then no file was given. This only occurs if the command was "encrypt" or "decrypt" since
it would otherwise not get this far before initialization() was called. So, an error is displayed on screen saying that no file was given.
Then it checks if the string ends with ".txt". If it does, then it should be fine as it will be an entire word
